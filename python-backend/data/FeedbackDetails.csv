As discussed, we had an overall negative experience with Narsimha.

He was on the project for a long time, and we spent a lot of time with him to perform design and build with the business.
We have also recorded all these sessions with the business - where many requirements were presented to him.

When it was time to show EWM in SAP, we noticed many of the requirements were not met.
It seemed to us that either he didn’t know how to configure SAP to meet ACP business requirements, or he simply ignored many of the requirements.
Ultimately, we ended up with a poor design that the business is very disappointed and frustrated with.
In fact, the ACP Warehouse team will have more work to do in SAP and may need to increase staff to support the new process.

Thanks,
Don

Subject: IBP problems 
 
Sundeep , Do you have anyone from offshore/onsite capable enough to take over from Vikas. 

I have had lots of complaints about him , not on his technical skills but he was very difficult to follow by any business users . I spoke to many many business users all feedbacks are the same. 

This has to be simplistic IBP implementations but it is getting more difficult because Vikas is arguing with business users, he is very difficult to follow most of the times and he is not listening. 
","- Need to customer interaction 
- Communication ","4","4","Submitted","Customer is not happy with his performance. Customer is not able to understand. Again, this was not critical for Go-live so i let it sit until go live. But before the client move to bring someone else we need to fix this.  Don was also not happy about Vikas. IBP is not high priority at the moment. We need to find a suitable alternative quickly before IBP issues bubble up. Vikas is not a going to be long term in this account. I tried to support him but he has very little appetite to change. He is skilled but not good at listening and even less in communication. So ACP struggle to do basic stuff in IBP.

4.	Distracted and not dedicated
5.	Takes lot of time to fix the issues

We (Me & Santanu) scheduled a call with Sriram to understand our side of things on this, it turned out to be very negative. It turned out to be a heated discussion and we found that client is not wrong here.

Client has withdrawn support from Offshore and wants to be supported from onshore now.

-	She semi-frequently independently does ‘just a little bit more’ research to propose alternative viewpoints or experiences other environments might use to solve a problem.  
-	Overall, she does not ‘knee jerk’ when analyzing issues, which is a key criteria for security work!
-	To her credit, she does not get frustrated by the reasonably high number of curve balls we throw at her (in general, but also with a recent ‘GRC project’ which puts a lot more complexity into her scope of work in the near term)

Only other point is for Chaitra to become even more confident in pushing back on process/design approaches.  She’s grown a lot in the last year, but at BBC some of core values revolve around our coworkers doing this!!","Our key constructive feedback is around turnaround time or overall duration things can take.  There is a very real challenge that our user provisioning processes are extremely manual and challenged with human error.  However, there are enough occasions where we think “I wonder why she has not acted on request X for a few days” ---- some of that is perfectly normal, but we’ve felt it enough over the last year that the feedback point is to somehow ‘drive action’ (without sacrificing due diligence).  Some of these events have happened when she has had some life events (moving, death in the family, etc) so this is far from a ‘real issue’ just something to be aware of.","6","7","Submitted",,"6",,"6",,"6",,,"7",,"7","I've attached the client feedback for Chaitra.

Dear AMS Team,

I want to thank the AMS team, particularly Harikishan, for your exceptional efforts in addressing the recent Azure over-cost issue in our non-production system.

 

Harikishan, your proactive approach in identifying the root cause and determining that it was a system-related issue was crucial in promptly resolving the matter. I truly appreciate the immediate and necessary steps you took to mitigate further costs. Your actions helped us escalate the issue effectively with Microsoft, which led to a favorable outcome and secured a credit adjustment of $43,000 for Delta.

 

Your dedication, problem-solving expertise, and quick thinking resolved a critical challenge and reinforced our confidence in the AMS team’s commitment to delivering value and support. Thank you for going above and beyond to ensure a successful resolution of this issue.

I look forward to our continued collaboration and shared success.","N/A","6","10","Submitted","N/A","10","N/A","10","N/A","10","N/A","N/A","10","N/A","10","N/A","10","Venkat Kolanupaka","12/2/2024 10:55 AM","Jay Johnson","12/2/2024 10:55 AM","Jay Johnson",,"Star of the Month","Project Feedback"

"1690","0608","Prasanna Ballal","Delivery Manager","Manager/Architect","Full-time Salaried","United States","IDC","Bengaluru","Maui Jim","MJS - SAP Support","SAP","Quote to Cash","Prasanna has domain knowledge in APO CIF and initially supported onboarding efforts during the Maui Jim engagement. However, his conduct during the assignment raised several concerns that are not aligned with expectations for someone with over 20 years of experience.

Despite being informed of ongoing client needs and delivery risks, Prasanna chose to discontinue daily reporting without ensuring a replacement was fully onboarded or that a proper handover was completed. Even after a direct call requesting interim support, he declined to assist, showing a lack of flexibility and ownership during a critical phase of the project. This disengagement occurred while the client was escalating concerns—resulting in delivery disruption and reputational risk.

Prasanna’s approach and attitude throughout this engagement did not reflect the maturity or leadership expected from a senior professional. AMS projects require long-term continuity and proactive problem-solving, and unfortunately, that was not demonstrated in this case.

Moving forward, it is essential that Prasanna takes greater responsibility for transitions, escalates blockers in real time, and upholds a client-first mindset aligned with his role and years of experience.","Key areas: ownership, responsiveness, client focus, and professional conduct","1","1","Submitted","Prasanna has good domain knowledge in APO CIF and demonstrated the ability to conduct knowledge transfer when requested. However, his inability to apply these skills effectively within the expectations of a long-term AMS engagement significantly impacted delivery. Despite being technically sound, the lack of ownership and proactive involvement reduced the overall effectiveness of his contribution.","2","No specific new skills were demonstrated during this period. While Prasanna was expected to take on broader AMS responsibilities and learn client-specific reporting processes, there was no visible effort made to adapt or scale beyond the initial KT, which remained static and transactional.","2","Initial work output was acceptable; however, the abrupt stoppage of APO reporting without proper transition or escalation resulted in a disruption to deliverables. The absence of continuity planning and failure to ensure reporting was covered negatively impacted both quality and timeliness from a client perspective.","1","Prasanna did not demonstrate the client-focused mindset expected in AMS projects. Refusing to support even during a critical escalation period and exiting without securing a replacement reflected poorly on the team’s ability to provide consistent service. This eroded client trust and put the engagement at risk.","Communication was inconsistent. While access limitations and bandwidth constraints were mentioned in isolated messages, there was no sustained communication or escalation to ensure issues were resolved. Critical project status updates were missed for weeks, which contributed to avoidable escalation.","1","No attendance issues were reported during this period.","5","Prasanna’s contribution to team efforts was limited. While he initially offered to mentor a new resource, he disengaged early without ensuring team stability. Refusal to support during a known period of high workload for the team reflects a lack of collaboration and reliability.","1","Pietri Jose","4/13/2025 11:50 AM","Saumadeep Sinha","4/13/2025 11:50 AM","Saumadeep Sinha",,"Performance Improvement Plan With HR","Project Feedback"

Hi Jeff & Ankur,
I would like to share with you a message of appreciation for the work that Vishal is doing for Pixart. In just a few months, he has created strong links of trust with the team, and he is being extremely helpful in helping us cope with the accumulated technical debt we have.
These days, there are a lot of open fronts: dealing with the upgrade to S/4HANA 2023, pressure from teams concerned about the upgrade blocking their development, and coordinating with Vandan to deploy patches. Vishal is managing all of this diligently and he is also taking the time to describe the actions to us so we gain context of the activity. I am learning thanks to him!
I am passing messages of gratitude to him but I also want to you be aware of that.
Thanks!

Conrado
